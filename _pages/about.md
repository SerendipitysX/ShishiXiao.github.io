Hi, welcome to my corner of the Internet!

I’m a undergraduate student at UESTC[(University of Electronic Science and Technology of China , 电子科技大学)](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) . I have broad interest in Machine Learning and Data Visualization, with special focus on Computer Vision and Data Mining. My current research topic is self-supervised learning . Always looking forward to AI + something interesting.
